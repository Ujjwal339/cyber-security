Video watched:

Computer Networking Full Course (freeCodeCamp) — sections on OSI & TCP/IP - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiQR5rTSshw

What I learned :

OSI vs TCP/IP layers, ports vs protocols, basics of TCP 3-way handshake.

Wireshark lab commands / steps:

Open Wireshark → select interface → start capture.

ping google.com while capturing.

Filter: icmp and tcp to inspect handshakes.

Observations:

Found SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK sequence for outbound TCP connections.
