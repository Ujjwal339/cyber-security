Today i deep dive into metsploit firmwware.
i learnt different modules and their uses :-
Auxiliary:-Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here.
encoders:-Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.
exploits:-Exploits, neatly organized by target system.
evasions:-While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software. On the other hand, “evasion” modules will try that, with more or less success.
NOPs:-NOPs (No OPeration) do nothing, literally. They are represented in the Intel x86 CPU family with 0x90, following which the CPU will do nothing for one cycle. They are often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload size
payloads:-Payloads are codes that will run on the target system.
posts:Post modules will be useful on the final stage of the penetration testing process listed above, post-exploitation.
